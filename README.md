## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis includes:
1. **Most Popular Shipping Modes**: Standard Class is the preferred choice, accounting for the majority of orders.
2. **Customer Segments**: The Consumer segment significantly outperforms others in order volume and profitability.
3. **Regional Profitability**: The South region exhibits the highest average profit, while the Central region faces potential losses.
4. **Profit Trends by Sub-Category**: Chairs are the most profitable sub-category, while Tables incur significant losses.
5. **Discount vs Profit**: Higher discounts are associated with lower profits, highlighting the need for pricing optimization.
6. **Sales vs Discount**: Discount and sales are not strongly correlated, highlighting the need for discount optimization.

## Key Insights
- The **Consumer segment** is the most profitable, offering opportunities for focused marketing.
- A **negative correlation between discounts and profits** suggests the importance of balanced pricing strategies.
- A **0.09 correlation between discount and sales** suggests the need of better discount strategies strategies.
- **Chairs** drive the highest profits, while **Tables** indicate inefficiencies, requiring further analysis.
